# Project 2 (bc-ver2) #
---
**NOTE:** This project uses Ant to build the sources.

## How to build ##

**Assuming you have Ant installed in the system**. Build the project simply by calling on

``` $ ant dist ```

This will generate the project's `jar` file.

## How to run ##

After building, you can run the program by issuing

```$ java -jar bc.jar < somefile.txt ```

Where `somefile.txt` contains a bc script.

## How to run tests ##

Just run the bash script in the root

```$ ./run-all-tests.sh ```

It will iterate over all the cases.
